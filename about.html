            At Savory, we have
            a common
            thread that resonates through everything we do: PASSION! We are passionate about the creation of our menus.
            We are
            passionate about our quality and where our food comes from. We are passionate about our people and the
            hospitality we
            show to our clients, our vendors, and each other.</p>

            sustainable
            practices, and inclusive standards. We are known for our love of food, commitment to our clients, and our
            “can-do”
